  author:       "Your Name"      # Your name
  discord:      "your_discord"      # Your discord username, for communication and automatically assigning you a Tapeout role (optional)
  description:  "VGA display with mouse cursor controlled by PS/2 input"      # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     25175000       # 25.175 MHz for VGA 640x480 @ 60Hz

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x2"          # Using 1x2 tiles for VGA + PS/2 design (more I/O pins needed)

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
  top_module:  "tt_um_vga_mouse"

  # List your project's source files here.
  # Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately, one per line.
  # Don't forget to also update `PROJECT_SOURCES` in test/Makefile.
